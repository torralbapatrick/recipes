Ingredients:
 - 3/4 cup white sugar
 - 1 cup heavy whipping cream
 - 2 1/4 cups milk
 - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
 1. Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat until sugar has 
 	dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and a small ring of foam appears 
 	around the edge.
 
 2. Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup.
 	Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours.
 
 3. Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and
 	churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.

 4. When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic
 	wrap directly on the ice cream and place in freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.
